__Problem Definition__:

Predictive policing is a multidimensional optimization problem. *Crime analysis* includes looking at the data from two different dimensions:

- **Spatial:** involves observing the characteristics of a particular region along with its neighbors.
- **Temporal:** nvolves observing the characteristics of a particular region over time.
Crime data are not easy to deal with. With both spatial and temporal attributes, processing them can be a challenging(deriving information from them) task.
